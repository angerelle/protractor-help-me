# Protractor and Cucumber

To get working on iMac

## Protractor

* Installed latest version of Node and NPM (had to completely remove 
previous version) - this meant that I could get the webdriver updated

* Updated Java, so that the webdriver would actually run

* Started the web server, `npm start`

* Got the Angular seed project Protractor tests working

## Cucumber JS

* Installed an older version of Cucumber JS so that the 
protractor-cucumber-framework would install `npm install cucumber@^0.9.1`

* Copied protractor config from <http://fizzylogic.nl/2016/10/14/How-to-write-ATDD-tests-with-cucumber-js-protractor-and-typescript/>
